# capstone-project-little-lemon

This is my capstone Project for Meta Front-End Developer path on Coursera. The Capstone course is course 8/9 of this path.
The idea of this project is to design the reserve-a-table function for the Little Lemon restaurant website. 
It is a fictional restaurant that is created by the learning path for us, learners, to work on.
